        <h4>
          1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
          decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>
        <p>
          In my previous job as a teacher, there was an opportunity for
          promotion that I applied for. There were multiple candidates who vied
          for the slots by racking up points in different areas like
          professional development participations and further studies. I had my
          recent achievements appraised with confidence to be among the top
          candidates. Since I am aware of how the point system goes, I had a
          rough estimate of my score. Before the results were published I had
          the opportunity to peek at it and I was surprised that I got a score
          higher than I expected. When I analyzed the breakdown, I realized that
          the secretary accidentally added twice the amount of points in one of
          the areas. If I remember correctly, I was about 2 points ahead of the
          third in rank which gives me a big chance to have that promotion. But
          my conscience did not succumb to the temptation. Even though that
          promotion could make a huge difference, I told the secretary with
          honesty about the error making the candidate who is behind me take my
          place in the ranking and eventually got the promotion. Sometimes I
          think that if I just kept quiet I would have been promoted but I never
          regretted my decision because it was the right thing to do besides my
          conscience is free.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          My family taught me to be kind, caring and generous. I grew up relying
          on my relatives' help and they are very much willing to extend that
          help to anyone in need without asking for something in return. I have
          a religious upbringing and I was exposed to church activities at a
          young age which prompted me to enter the seminary. There, I studied
          Philosophy where it was supposed to help me broaden my understanding
          about spirituality but instead grappled me with questions which I
          still haven’t figured out. So, I went out of the seminary, though I
          can still see myself as a devout Catholic with an on and off
          relationship with the Church. Nevertheless, I have learned a lot as a
          seminarian as it was my training ground which honed me in areas of
          leadership, communication, collaboration and autonomy. After that, I
          met my soon to be girlfriend and now my wife who oriented me to the
          workings of the emotions. Before, I was a bit intolerant with things
          outside of reason but in our rollercoaster ride of a long distance
          relationship it developed in me a sense of purpose that I do not exist
          for myself but for others especially to those who are close to my
          heart.

        <h4> 
          3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>
        <p>
          According to the dope test, I am an OWL (45%) which means I am a
          detail seeker and have low assertiveness and emotionality. Also, I
          tend to be more logical, mathematically minded, methodical and
          sometimes seen as perfectionist. I can be slow to make decisions and
          inflexible if rules and logic says otherwise. I am not a big risk
          taker but love detail. I certainly agree with the results, especially
          with my personality and strengths. I am a logical and methodical
          thinker who often would question things that are unreasonable and seem
          out of order. This is simply demonstrated when shopping. I often
          wonder if the item is necessary like "why buy shoes when I still have
          a couple" or "it's a good deal but we don't have our own house yet".
          Also, I like to do everything in order and follow each step
          sequentially. This can be a strength to manage impulses but a weakness
          when making quick decisions.
        </p>
        <h4>
          4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have no coding or programming experience and I still struggle to
          find my routine. I can’t do anything with the first one but it
          shouldn’t be a worry as the course is tailored for beginners like me
          but the second one can hugely impact my learning journey. Moreover, it
          is important to find the right balance of pushing oneself and allowing
          oneself to rest when considering wellbeing. My goal at the end of
          foundations but hopefully before that is I establish a routine for
          myself that takes wellbeing into account and recognize that there are
          support systems available.
        </p>
        <h4>
          5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I recognize that working with others is one of my weaknesses not
          because I am too overbearing but because I tend to keep to myself. I
          used to have a really low self-esteem that whenever there was a group
          discussion I used to think my ideas were less important. A lot of
          these instances happened in my previous job as a teacher in a new
          country. Although the team is very supportive and understanding, I was
          not proactive enough to contribute. At times, I tried to suck it up
          and express myself but I reverted to being a wallflower when my ideas
          were not recognized. I could change this by listening more and asking
          questions in a timely manner when I can’t understand something because
          basically, collaboration won’t happen when there is no effective
          communication.
