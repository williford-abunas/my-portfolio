        <h4>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I learned I can achieve something if I put my mind into it.</li>
          <li>I've learned about some of my destructive habits</li>
          <li>I learned that it's ok to be wrong when trying to learn</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Values will help build relationships with ourselves and others.
          Empathy will help in understanding one's colleagues and working with
          them. It will also help when you are trying to build a solution for a
          customer's problem. Self-awareness will help keep one's mental well -
          being in a healthy state.
        </p>
        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          I like how it focuses on the human side of programming and how the
          brain works. What surprised me the most is the amount of change or
          mindset that I gained in such a short time. I haven't applied
          everything yet but knowing and dipping my toes in praciticing
          strategies like reflection, empathy through listening/looping, as well
          as timeboxing made me realize their importance and practicability.
        </p>
        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <p>
          Timeboxing for me most of the time as well as getting help when
          stucked.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think core learning is important because of the fact that we will be
          dealing with people in the workplace. Having positive values will help
          not only a person to grow but also those people around.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Definitely not a waste of time. I believe without studying about
          ourselves and how we relate to others would make us robots instead of
          persons.
