        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <h4>1. That time I was blocked on a simple problem:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><i>What was the problem?</i></li>
          <p>
            I can see in the console.log that my code is working and giving what
            is similar to the expected results.
          </p>
          <li><i>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</i></li>
          <p>
            I tried to revise the code in different ways. And of course, none of
            them worked. In the end, I have no other choice but to ask for help.
            I tried the test but I was not reading it carefully so when I asked
            a peer he directed me to what the test says. Then, I realized that I
            shouldn’t have added a space somewhere.
          </p>
          <li><i>How did you feel throughout the process?</i></li>
          <p>
            There’s a point when I feel hopeless where everything I’m trying is
            not working. There’s an “Aha” moment when you find out that the
            solution is actually just simple.
          </p>
          <li><i>What did you learn?</i></li>
          <p>
            I learned to pay attention not only to the console.log but to the
            test as well. I also learned that asking for help from a peer makes
            you step out and see a different perspective that will help you find
            the missing piece.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h4>2. That time when I elegantly solved a problem:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><i>What was the problem?</i></li>
          <p>
            I can’t write functions from scratch. Translating instructions to
            code is a challenge.
          </p>
          <li><i>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</i></li>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Practice, practice, practice. Try doing things again and again
              while verbalizing what hapeens in the process.
            </li>
            <li>Console logging and running test to check.</li>
            <li>Treating google and youtube as my go to friends</li>
            <li>Asking for help when completely stuck</li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          <li><i>How did you feel throughout the process?</i></li>
          <p>
            I can’t exactly say that this problem is elegantly solved but I’m
            just recognizing the improvement I made as I can now better
            understand how to write a function from given instructions.
          </p>
          <li><i>What did you learn?</i></li>
          <p>
            I learned that by constant practice you can learn difficult concepts
            and skills.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
          problem-solving techniques/processes: (Very confident, confident, a
          bit confident, not confident)
        </h4>
        <table border="1">
          <tr>
            <td>Pseudocode - not confident</td>
            <td>Googling - very confident</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Trying something - very confident</td>
            <td>Asking your peers for help - a bit confident</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Reading error messages - not confident</td>
            <td>Asking coaches for help - a bit confident</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Console.logging - confident</td>
            <td>Improving your process with reflection - a bit confident</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Rubber ducky method - a bit confident</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <h4>
          4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I was reluctant to ask for help because I can see that most of my
          peers are moving on steadily with the course. I was hesitant that my
          question would be outdated. Next time, I need to fire any question
          right away and adjust my working hours to suit available mentors.
