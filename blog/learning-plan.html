          1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          I have been accepted to participate in the ServiceNow bootcamp. Along
          with my Devacademy stint, I hope I can combine the skills I acquire to
          become a ServiceNow Developer in the future. If things don't fall into
          place I will seek any entry job in the tech industry just so I could
          develop skills befitting a role that could turn into a stable career.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center">
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning.
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          I love learning but I also struggle with anxiety and misplaced
          expectations. When I tried the tools to assess my strengths I found
          out that my top five were Fairness, Judgment, Curiosity, Prudence and
          Love of Learning. Another good thing is I recognize failure as part of
          learning. It is just sometimes I find it difficult to ask someone for
          help.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center">
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          I would like to develop more of my social and communication skills. I
          am usually reserved and quiet at times not because I want to but I’m
          just socially anxious. In addition to this, I would like to develop my
          collaboration skills especially in working with a group who I have
          never met before.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center">
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage
          yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives. What you will do
          when things are building up and starting to get to you.
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          In the foundations, I decided to commit 100% of my time so I am
          flexible but at this point, I realized that I need organization. I am
          committed to be present in every meeting, reply or comment if I can
          contribute and let facilitators know anything in relation to the
          course. As things start to get me, I find that taking a break and
          finding a new environment helpful in relieving brain fog. Taking a
          short breathing exercise every now and then also helps me to think.
          Also, focusing on the task at hand and allotting time frames for each
          task allows me to manage distractions.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center">
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          I totally agree with the advice in this course that having a growth
          mindset or doing my very best before looking for answers in other
          sources would maximize learning. In case, I come to a roadblock, I
          know I can find valuable information in the Discord community or
          directly address a query to the facilitators or peers. I need to
          remind myself that I could ask for help right away before frustration
          builds up and takes the better of me.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center">
          6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          I enjoy how the facilitator team addresses things in a timely manner
          and with humor. There’s a human touch in the way they communicate that
          reassures participants it’s ok to make mistakes or to be not perfect
          in certain areas. I don’t have anything to expect but for them to
          continue doing a good job.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center">
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h4>
        <p class="center">
          Not really. I need to plan my waking and sleeping hours. The breaks in
          between coursework and some exercise. Only thing that goes in my way
          is my mental health and wellbeing in general.
