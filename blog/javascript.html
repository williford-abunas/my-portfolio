        <h3>Javascript Fundamentals</h3>
        <h4>1. The Power Front - End Trio: HTML, CSS and Javascript</h4>
        <p>
          For starters HTML, CSS and Javascript are the languages responsible
          for what we see as we land on different websites while surfing the
          internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really liked the analogy that my friend Google showed me about these
          three. It says that HTML is the builder, CSS is the artist and
          JavaScript is the wizard. Here’s a basic description of what each
          does:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML (“Hypertext Markup Language”) is responsible for the basic
            structure of a webpage. In simple terms, we use HTML to put elements
            like headings, paragraphs, texts, images, links, etc. in the order
            that we want to. It’s like writing a formal letter.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            CSS (“Cascading Style Sheets”) is responsible for the design aspect
            of a webpage. Like an artist, it makes a webpage colorful by adding
            visual effects and background color. It can also customize the
            elements in the HTML as well as affect its structure.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            JavaScript is responsible for basically anything you can imagine you
            can do in a webpage. This is why it is likened to a wizard that can
            do MAGIC! It makes web pages dynamic by applying interactive
            behavior like having a certain kind of animation when you click
            something. It is also used to build applications and even games. And
            just like magic it takes effect instantly without the need to
            refresh the page.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="explain-function">2. Control Flow and Loops</h4>
        <p>
          Control Flow is the technical term for specifying the sequence in
          which a code executes.
          (https://codeinstitute.net/global/blog/control-flow-in-javascript/)
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put number 1, it is what happens behind the scenes when you
          interact with a software or program like when you click or press a
          key.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simply put number 2, it is how the code runs after you fire a signal
          by clicking or pressing something in the web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, code runs in a top-down manner unless you define its
          course with structures such as Functions, Conditionals and Loops:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Functions are a set of statements that indicate a procedure which
            you can use repeatedly. For example, everytime a visitor enters your
            door you greet them by saying “Good day, (First name)” and when they
            leave “Good bye, (First name)”. When compared with everyday life,
            functions refer to how we do our chores. For example, when you cook
            there are different steps like start a fire, add salt, add meat or
            add water. Each of these are functions that can be called in any
            order we want to. Be mindful of the sequence or else you skip
            dinner!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Conditionals, well from the term “condition”, refers to a flow
            structure that involves choices or selection. For example, while
            cooking there comes a part when you check for the taste. Here, there
            are two possible actions you can do to proceed depending whether the
            preferred taste is met:
          </li>
          <p>a. If it is bland, add salt, or</p>
          <p>b. If it is salty, add water.</p>
          <li>
            Loops refer to replaying or repeating the same action, in this case,
            running the same block of code until you set the condition to stop.
            So, imagine you are still doing the same cooking. From time to time
            you are checking the taste and adding salt or water as per
            conditions. Then, you are looping through the tasting and adding
            until you are satisfied with the taste which breaks the loop.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          3. Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact
          with it.
        </h4>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model is a data structure that represents the page
          you see in your browser. It is a copy of the page’s HTML but
          represented as a JavaScript object. Here you can select HTML elements,
          execute events, methods and add properties such as style. One way you
          can interact with it is by creating events to make your web page
          interactive. See pictures below:
        </p>

        <h4>
          4. Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and
          objects.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Arrays are lists of items or values under a single name. The syntax is
          ArrayName = [ item1, item2, item3,... ].
        </p>
        <p>E.g. Filipino Food = [ Adobo, Balut, Lechon, Bulalo ]</p>
        <p>
          You can access an item from an array by referring to the index number.
          Index number is the position of the item in the array which starts at
          [0].
        </p>
        <p>
          E.g. Filipino Food = [ Adobo, Balut, Lechon, Bulalo ] [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]
        </p>
        <p>So, if I my favorite is Balut, i’d put:</p>
        <p>Let favorite = Filipino Food[1], which equates to</p>
        <p>Favorite = “Balut”</p>
        <p>
          Objects are variables but can contain many values which are called
          properties. The properties are written as name:value pairs (name and
          value separated by a colon).
        </p>
        <p>
          E.g. phone = { brand: “Samsung”, model: “Flip5”, color: “black”, year:
          2023 }
        </p>
        <p>You can access object properties in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using dot(.) E.g. phone.brand</li>
          <p>console.log = Samsung</p>
          <li>Using square brackets ([ ]) E.g. phone[“brand”]</li>
          <p>console.log = Samsung</p>
        </ul>
