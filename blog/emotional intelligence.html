        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <h4>1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
        <p>
          (EI or EQ for "emotional quotient") is the ability to perceive,
          interpret, demonstrate, control, evaluate, and use emotions to
          communicate with and relate to others effectively and constructively.

        </p>
        <p>
          It is vital to be able to express and control one's emotions, but it
          is also important to be able to understand, interpret, and respond to
          the emotions of others. Some experts believe that emotional
          intelligence is more important than IQ for long-term success.
        </p>
        <h4>2. How is EQ different from IQ?</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Intelligence quotient</strong>, or <strong>IQ</strong>, is a
          number used to express a person's overall mental ability. This score
          is derived from a standardized test. On the original IQ tests, scores
          were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by
          chronological age and multiplying that number by 100. A child with a
          mental age of 15 and a chronological age of 10 would have an IQ of
          150.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, scores on most IQ tests are calculated by comparing the test
          taker's score to the average scores of other people in the same age
          group. IQ represents abilities such as: visual and spatial processing,
          knowledge of the world, fluid reasoning, working memory and short-term
          memory, and quantitative reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Emotional intelligence</strong> or <strong>EQ</strong> refers
          to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express
          emotions. Researchers such as John Mayer and Peter Salovey, as well as
          writers like Daniel Goleman, have helped shine a light on emotional
          intelligence, making it a hot topic in areas ranging from business
          management to education. EQ is centered on abilities such as:
          identifying emotions, evaluating how others feel, controlling one's
          own emotions, perceiving how others feel, using emotions to facilitate
          social communication, and relating to others

        <h4>3. Why is EQ important?</h4>
        <p>
          What are the benefits of emotional intelligence in the workplace?
          Emotionally intelligent employees bring a positive energy to an
          organisation. Genos International, an emotional intelligence product
          and service provider, states that high emotional intelligence improves
          career success, mental health, relationship satisfaction and
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence also allows you to enhance your communication
          and interpersonal skills. Effectively interacting with others is as
          much about listening with empathy to their point of view as it is
          communicating your own perspective. Emotional intelligence helps you
          control your own emotions during a conversation, understand the other
          personâ€™s motivation and emotional state, build a meaningful
          relationship and respond appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Emotionally intelligent workplaces also excel at teamwork and adapting
          to change. The flow-on effects for organisations are better
          productivity, engagement, morale and public reputation. For instance,
          in the sales and service industry alone, Genos International notes
          that professionals with high EI can read customers well, build better
          relationships, influence buyers and build trust.
